### Basic Sankey Diagram


```r
library(plotly)

p <- plot_ly(
    type = "sankey",
    orientation = "h",
    
    node = list(
      label = c("A1", "A2", "B1", "B2", "C1", "C2"),
      color = c("blue", "blue", "blue", "blue", "blue", "blue"),
      pad = 15,
      thickness = 20,
      line = list(
        color = "black",
        width = 0.5
      )
    ),
    
    link = list(
      source = c(0,1,0,2,3,3),
      target = c(2,3,3,4,4,5),
      value =  c(8,4,2,8,4,2)
    )
  ) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Basic Sankey Diagram",
    font = list(
      size = 10
    )
)

### Create Canvas


```r
library(plotly)

p <- plot_ly(
    type = "sankey",
    domain = list(
      x =  c(0,1),
      y =  c(0,1)
    ),
    orientation = "h",
    valueformat = ".0f",
    valuesuffix = "TWh"
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Energy forecast for 2050, UK - Department of Energy & Climate Change",
    font = list(
      size = 10
    ),
    xaxis = list(showgrid = F, zeroline = F),
    yaxis = list(showgrid = F, zeroline = F)
  )
```


### Add Nodes


```r
library(plotly)
library(rjson)

json_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/plotly.js/master/test/image/mocks/sankey_energy.json"
json_data <- fromJSON(paste(readLines(json_file), collapse=""))

p <- plot_ly(
    type = "sankey",
    domain = list(
      x =  c(0,1),
      y =  c(0,1)
    ),
    orientation = "h",
    valueformat = ".0f",
    valuesuffix = "TWh",
    
    node = list(
      label = json_data$data[[1]]$node$label,
      color = json_data$data[[1]]$node$color,
      pad = 15,
      thickness = 15,
      line = list(
        color = "black",
        width = 0.5
      )
    )
  ) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Energy forecast for 2050, UK - Department of Energy & Climate Change",
    font = list(
      size = 10
    ),
    xaxis = list(showgrid = F, zeroline = F),
    yaxis = list(showgrid = F, zeroline = F)
)
```

### Add Links


```r
library(plotly)
library(rjson)

json_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/plotly.js/master/test/image/mocks/sankey_energy.json"
json_data <- fromJSON(paste(readLines(json_file), collapse=""))

    ),
    orientation = "h",
    valueformat = ".0f",
    valuesuffix = "TWh",
    
    node = list(
      label = json_data$data[[1]]$node$label,
      color = json_data$data[[1]]$node$color,
      pad = 15,
      thickness = 15,
      line = list(
        color = "black",
        width = 0.5
      )
    ),
    
    link = list(
      source = json_data$data[[1]]$link$source,
      target = json_data$data[[1]]$link$target,
      value =  json_data$data[[1]]$link$value,
      label =  json_data$data[[1]]$link$label
    )
  ) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Energy forecast for 2050<br>Source: Department of Energy & Climate Change, Tom Counsell via <a href='https://bost.ocks.org/mike/sankey/'>Mike Bostock</a>",
    font = list(

### Define Node Position
The following example sets [node.x](https://plot.ly/r/reference/#sankey-node-x) and `node.y` to place nodes in the specified locations, except in the `snap arrangement` (default behaviour when `node.x` and `node.y` are not defined) to avoid overlapping of the nodes, therefore, an automatic snapping of elements will be set to define the padding between nodes via [nodepad](https://plot.ly/r/reference/#sankey-node-pad). The other possible arrangements are:<font color='blue'> 1)</font> perpendicular <font color='blue'>2)</font> freeform <font color='blue'>3)</font> fixed


```r
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(
  type = "sankey",
  arrangement = "snap",
  node = list(
    label = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"),
    x = c(0.2, 0.1, 0.5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.5),
    y = c(0.7, 0.5, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3),
    pad = 10), # 10 Pixel
  link = list(
    source = c(0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 5),
    target = c(5, 3, 4, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3),
    value = c(1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2))) %>%
  layout(title = "Sankey with manually positioned node")
