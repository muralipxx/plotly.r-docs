### Basic Waterfall Chart


```r
library(plotly)

x= list("Sales", "Consulting", "Net revenue", "Purchases", "Other expenses", "Profit before tax")
measure= c("relative", "relative", "total", "relative", "relative", "total")
text= c("+60", "+80", "", "-40", "-20", "Total")
y= c(60, 80, 0, -40, -20, 0)
data = data.frame(x=factor(x,levels=x),measure,text,y)

p <- plot_ly(
  data, name = "20", type = "waterfall", measure = ~measure,
  x = ~x, textposition = "outside", y= ~y, text =~text,
  connector = list(line = list(color= "rgb(63, 63, 63)"))) %>%
  layout(title = "Profit and loss statement 2018",
        xaxis = list(title = ""),
        yaxis = list(title = ""),
        autosize = TRUE,
        showlegend = TRUE)

p
```

### Setting Marker Size and Color
This example uses [decreasing, increasing, and total attributes](https://plot.ly/r/reference/#waterfall-decreasing-marker-line-color) to customize the bars.


```r
library(plotly)

y = c(375, 128, 78, 0, -327, -78, 0, 32, 89, 0, -45, 0)
x = c("Sales", "Consulting", "Maintenance", "Net revenue", "Purchases", "Material expenses", "Operating profit", "Investment income", "Financial income",
"Profit before tax", "Income tax (15%)", "Profit after tax")
measure = c("relative", "relative", "relative", "total", "relative", "relative", "total", "relative", "relative", "total", "relative", "total")
data = data.frame(x=factor(x,levels = x), y, measure)

P <- plot_ly(data, x = ~x, y = ~y, measure = ~measure, type = "waterfall", base = 300, decreasing = list(marker = list(color = "Maroon", line = list(color = "red", width = 2))),
increasing = (marker = list(color = "Teal")),
totals = list(marker = list(color = "deep sky blue", line = list(color = 'blue', width = 3))))%>%
layout(title = "Profit and loss statement", xaxis = list(title = "", tickfont = "16", ticks = "outside"),
yaxis = list(title = ""), waterfallgap = "0.3")
